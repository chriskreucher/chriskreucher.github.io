I am a Senior Technical Fellow and Analytics & Exploitation Group Lead at [KBR](www.kbr.com) (formerly Integrity Applications Incorporated) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. From 1998 to 2008, 
I was a Staff Scientist at General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems' Michigan 
Research & Development Facility (formerly ERIM). 

My current research areas include multisensor fusion, nonlinear filtering, information theory, multitarget tracking, and sensor management. I have a particular interest in applying these approaches to data, including multistatic radar, passive acoustics, and EO.
