I am a Senior Technical Fellow and Analytics & Exploitation Group Lead at [KBR](https://www.kbr.com) (formerly Integrity Applications Incorporated) in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

From 1998 to 2008, I was a Staff Scientist at General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems' Michigan 
Research & Development Facility (formerly [ERIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Research_Institute_of_Michigan)). 

I earned the PhD in Electrical Engineering (Systems) from [The University of Michigan](https://www.umich.edu) in 2005.

My current research areas include multisensor fusion, nonlinear filtering, information theory, multitarget tracking, and sensor management. I have a particular interest in applying these approaches to data, including multistatic radar, passive acoustics, and EO.
