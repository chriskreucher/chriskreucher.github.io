Homework Solutions
======
Some students have asked for solutions to homework assignments so they
can check their work. These postings are meant to address that
request.<br>

Please note, however, that the instructor is using the 5th edition of
the book "Basic Engineering Circuit Analysis", by Irwin. Therefore,
some of the assigned problems may be different in your edition. To
mitigate this problem, I have posted both the problems and solutions
here.<br>

It is perfectly acceptable to work problems from your text book
instead of (or in addition to) those listed here. There is nothing
special or magical about these particular problems. In this class,
repition and practice are key.
